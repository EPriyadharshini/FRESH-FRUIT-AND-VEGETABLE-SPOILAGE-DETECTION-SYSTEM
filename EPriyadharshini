FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SPOILAGE DETECTION SYSTEM
About:
The Food Spoilage Detection project leverages computer vision and deep learning to automatically identify spoiled food items from images. Using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, the system classifies images of fruits and vegetables as fresh or spoiled. This project provides a real-time, automated, and reliable method for monitoring food quality, reducing wastage, and enhancing food safety.

Built with Python and libraries like PyTorch, Torchvision, timm, and PIL, the system captures images via a web interface and predicts food freshness using a trained ViT model. It offers immediate feedback, making it suitable for households, grocery stores, and restaurants aiming to manage food efficiently and safely.

Features:
Automated Food Spoilage Detection: Classifies food items as fresh or spoiled in real-time.

Deep Learning Model: Uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) trained on images of fruits and vegetables.

Web Interface: Users can upload images via a Flask-based web app.

Confidence-Based Alerts: Provides warnings if the model is uncertain about the classification.

Multi-Food Support: Works with various fruits and vegetables.

Real-Time Feedback: Instant prediction displayed on the interface for quick decision-making.

Requirements:
Programming Language: Python 3.7+ Libraries:

PyTorch: For building and running deep learning models.

Torchvision: For dataset handling and image transforms.

timm: For pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

OpenCV / PIL: For image processing.

Flask: For building the web interface.

Hardware:
Camera or image upload support via web.

Moderate CPU/GPU for real-time inference.

IDE: Any Python-compatible IDE (PyCharm, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook).

System Architecture:

Input Capture:

Users upload images of food items via the Flask web interface.

Preprocessing:

Images are resized to 224x224, normalized, and transformed into tensors.

Spoilage Prediction:

The pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model predicts whether the food is fresh or spoiled.

Softmax probabilities are calculated to provide confidence scores.

Result Display:
Flask renders the prediction and confidence percentage on the web page.

If the confidence is below 70%, a warning is displayed to indicate uncertainty.

Model Training (Optional):

Model can be retrained using additional labeled datasets for improved accuracy.

Trains with data augmentations (resize, horizontal flip, normalization) for robustness.
